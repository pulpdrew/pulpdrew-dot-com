summary: Why do we go to war? What is the difference between patriotism and nationalism? How can we learn to trust those that are different? The Left Hand of Darkness, while most notable for its examination of a sexless, genderless human society, also wrestles with these questions. Ursula K. Le Guinâ€™s novel has layers. On one, it is an anthropological field guide to a frozen planet, lightyears away, and it's strange human inhabitants. On another, it is the allegorical tale of a communal bureaucracy with a desire to expand pitted against a disparate federation being driven to fear and aggression by fear-mongering leaders. But at its heart, the novel is the story of two people, alien to each other, learning to trust and love one another in a harsh world.
