rating: 6
summary: Written by journalist Malcom Gladwell, this book is a refutation of the idea that hard work is all one needs to succeed. *Outliers* largely consists of a series of anecdotes exploring the lives of people we consider to be successful and examining the factors that have led to their success. Bill Gates was aided by the affluence of his parents and teachers, professional sports players owe much of their success to the date on which they were born, and the safety record of aviation industries depends, in part, on the culture of communication that its pilots were born into. Gladwell points out the ways in which luck, privilege, and rare opportunities play a part in success and argues that hard work, while a necessary component of success, is not sufficient.
