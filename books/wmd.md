summary: The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and Cathy O'Neil says math is to blame. In her book, "Weapons of Math Destruction," she argues that statistical models and big data threaten our society and democracy by undermining criminal and racial justice, exacerbating wealth inequality, and destroying our collective ability to see the world as others see it. As a former math professor turned Wall Street quant turned big data activist, O'Neil is perhaps uniquely qualified to diagnose these problems and present potential solutions. She makes it clear, however, that it is up to all of us to demand accountability, transparency, and fairness.
