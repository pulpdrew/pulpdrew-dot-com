### Ingredients:

- About 8 oz mini twist pretzels
- 1 cup salted butter (do not use margarine)
- 1 cup light brown sugar
- 1 bag (2 cups) milk chocolate chips

### Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 11x17-inch baking sheet (with edges) with parchment paper.
2. Spread pretzels onto the prepared baking sheet so that they are just touching, but not overlapping.
3. Combine butter and brown sugar in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and mixture is thickened, 5-10 minutes (Mixture will bubble and turn a lighter color when it is done).
4. Pour mixture over pretzels. It will spread more evenly once placed in the oven.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. 
6. Remove from oven, let cool 1 minute. Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over pretzel mixture. Bake for 2 minute more. Spread melted chocolate over pretzels with a rubber spatula.
7. Cool until set, 2 to 3 hours. Break into pieces.
