A Japanese restaurant near the arena. The downstairs is a Ramen shop, and is always busy - I haven't tried it yet. But the upstairs takes reservations and serves tasty small plates. I particularly loved the confit garlic with miso-kimchi sauces and the fried Karaage chicken thighs. The plates are fairly generous, though you should expect to order abotu 3-4 per person.
