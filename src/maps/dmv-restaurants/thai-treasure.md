A quiet, stylish Thai restaurant along Fairfax Drive in the Virginia Square neighborhood of Arlington. The menu is fairly standard for Thai restaurants, offering the traditional noodles, rice, and curry dishes, along with some "signature" protein dishes. The food was good, but slightly towards the greasy side.
