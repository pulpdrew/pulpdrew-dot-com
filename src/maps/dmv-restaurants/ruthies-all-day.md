A cute, bustling, and straightforward American restaurant serving a pretty large range of classics, deliciously prepared and reasonably priced. I've enjoyed all of the dishes I have gotten there, but the cornbread holds a special place in my heart. Make sure to get a reservation if you want to go on the weekend.
