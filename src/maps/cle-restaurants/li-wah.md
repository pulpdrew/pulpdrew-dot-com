A busy Dim Sum joint in Cleveland's Asia-town. Dim Sum is best experienced with a group of 3-5 as a weekend brunch, as this will allow you to try the largest variety of small plates. 

It's very fun to watch the carts of food roll around, but be aware that unless you are a Dim Sum expert, it may be tricky to figure out what the offerings are and how much they cost.
