_Project Hail Mary_ is a lot like Weir's previous successful novel, _The Martian_. A smart astronaut finds himself in a pickle and has to use science to solve his problems. In this story, the man is not only out to save himself, but all of Earth as well. The science is well done and interesting, and the plot kept me entertained.

This is also a very... optimistic story. Humans and human institutions band together in a way that seems extremely unlikely, even in the face of certain disaster. In that way, this novel is very different from most that I read, and most of the science fiction that is published these days. And to be honest it is pretty refreshing, if unrealistic. Overall, it's a fun, interesting story that's easy to read and entertaining, but it isn't trying to explore any particularly deep themes.
