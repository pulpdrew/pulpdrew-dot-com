The first in a trilogy, this novel tells the stories of a pair of scientists - one searching for life among the stars during the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the other investigating strange occurences in modern-day China. Cixin is explicit that, like authors from American science fiction's *Golden Age*, his goal is to create imaginative plots full of interesting hard science. If that's what you're looking for, then this book is for you. However, like the *Golden Age* authors before him, his imaginative plot in *The Three Body Problem* often comes at the expense of fully developed characters, convincing dialog, or acknowledgement of social or political issues. So if those are the things you look for in a book, then you may want to look elsewhere.
