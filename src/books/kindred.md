Sometimes described as "a time-travel slave narrative," this novel is an interesting fusion of the science fiction, fantasy, historical fiction, and African American fiction genres. Most of the story is set on a slave plantation in the first half of the 19th century. Dana, a black woman from 1976, has been stranded there by unexplained time-travel and tasked with saving a white boy named Rufus. Butler's characters are realistic and relatable, and the effects of the time-travel (if not the causes) are well thought-out. Dana's wit and her love for several other characters add some relief to an otherwise dark book, making _Kindred_ a fairly enjoyable read.

Butler wrote the novel largely to make a statement against young, militant black people of her own generation that criticized older black people for being too submissive, for not pushing hard enough for change. Throughout the book, she depicts her characters, both black and white, as easily growing complacent with slavery. White characters rationalize their place in society and become increasingly desensitized to the violence around them as they grow up within a system that tells them it is normal. Conversely, many enslaved blacks are conditioned to accept submissiveness in order to survive the brutality. She's clear though, in the end, that white people are not innocent when they accept and perpetuate inequality. She also offers endless admiration for those that _did_ resist slavery and fight for freedom, despite the risks. Her message is clear - fight for equality, but don't do so by fighting those that are the victims of inequality.
