This expansive, nine book space opera seeks to bridge the gap between near-future, sol-only science fiction and far-future, galaxy-spanning science fiction. Books 1-3 focus on conflict between UN-led Earth, a colonized Mars, and largely oppressed inhabitants of far flung asteroids and space stations (the Belters, as they call themselves). Books 4-6 focus on a conflict between a Belter extremist group and an Earth. Finally, Books 7-9 focus on a conflict between a Fascist empire led by former Martians and an assorted mix of rebels called the resistance. The Star Wars vibes are minimal, I promise. However, there are some slightly fantastical elements to the story - namely that a mysterious, extra-terrestrial artifact appears and does some funky stuff throughout the series, including enabling travel to other solar systems through a set of "rings."

Each book is told in an ever-changing set of perspectives, typically about four per book. This is nice because it enables the authors to tell larger stories without (a) compromising their scientifically-plausible depiction of space travel and communication and (b) without it seeming entirely like a character is somehow involved in every interesting thing that happens in the solar system. I say "entirely" because there is one character, the obnoxiously-moral Captain James Holden, who does have a perspective role in (almost) every book, and seems to be _quite_ involved in most interesting things that happen. The authors do recognize this and poke fun at it in a subtle way, but it's clear that the narrative does benefit from having some continuity.

In terms of themes, the authors seem to express some philosophical ideas through their characters, particularly Holden. At times, they do a really good job of building up two sides of an argument. In book four, for example, the conflict between the energy corporation and the colonists is pretty well done. The ideological fight between Jim and the Belter insurgent Marco in books 5-6 is pretty interesting as well. However, I found the themes to be less compelling in books 7-9, as they took a backseat to the (admittedly more engaging) plot.

Overall, I think this is a really fun series. The writing quality is good enough, and improves throughout the series. But the characters and story are fun, and the series kept me entertained over a few years of intermittently reading them. As a side note, the TV series is also pretty good, though not quite as good as the books, especially thematically.
