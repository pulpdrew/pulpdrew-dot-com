Continuing onto the second book in the _Foundation_ Series, this book covers the next few hundred years of Foundation development. The Foundation's history during this period is dominated by some wars with the remnants of the Old Empire. There aren't that many themes that I found interesting in this book. It also takes a strange turn towards something that feels pretty fantastical for an Asimov novel, which I don't think fits in very well with the first part of the series (I don't care for the Mule character).

This second novel, despite having _some_ female characters, feels even more sexist than the first. While the female character is (thankfully) somewhat competent, the attitudes of male characters towards female characters often feel very 1950s-ish. Which I suppose is to be expected from 1950s popular sci-fi.
