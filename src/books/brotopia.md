This is a well-written, straight-forward overview of the history and present state of sexism in the technology industry. Chang's writing is engaging and accessible. She makes a strong argument in favor of improving gender diversity at technology companies, and provides some concrete suggestions about how to do so. She directly refutes most counter arguments, or makes concessions where necessary, making this a very persuasive book. Overall, it's a full summary of the topic that addresses all three of "Where are we at right now?" "How did we get here?" and "How do we get to somewhere else?"
