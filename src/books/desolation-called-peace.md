_A Desolation Called Peace_ is the somewhat-dissapointing-but-still-pretty-good sequel to _A Memory Called Empire_. Mahit and her liason Three Seagrass are back, but Martine also throws in some additional perspectives, belonging to the imperial heir and an imperial "Yaotlek" (~admiral) charged with waging war against mysterious aliens. This book is in many ways a step back from the previous one. The additional perspectives leave less time to develop each character, making the story quite plot-driven. The focus of that plot is squarely on the on-going war and a tense first-contact situation. These are interesting plot points, but they don't allow for as much world-building as Mahit's journey around the imperial capital did. Finally, the themes of colonialism and loneliness that were so well done in _A Memory Called Empire_ take a back seat to cool aliens and romantic drama. 

That's not to say the book isn't still good! The aliens really _are_ cool, the first contact situation _is_ tense, and the politics are once again very well developed. I am just hoping that the third book turns out a little more like the first one.
