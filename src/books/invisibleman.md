Being invisible isn’t as easy as it sounds, at least not for this novel’s titular character, Griffin. The godfather of sci-fi, H.G. Wells, examines some of the practical issues that may result from transparency in Victorian England. Despite the novel’s short length, Wells manages to include a fair amount of his trademark social criticism. It is poverty and isolation that drives Griffin to his most violent and exploitative acts. And in the end, it is a community of people, united together, that faces off against Griffin’s lonely reign of terror.
