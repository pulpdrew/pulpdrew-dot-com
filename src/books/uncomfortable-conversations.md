Inspired by the YouTube series of the same name, this short book consists of fifteen thoughtful, accessible, and important "conversations" about race and racism. Author and former NFL linebacker Emmanuel Acho covers topics such as cultural appropriation, racism in the justice system, and effective allyship. Through it all, Acho remains committed to honestly sharing his own experiences, as well as some well-researched facts and recommendations for further reading. In short, this book is Acho's attempt to broach topics that are sometimes regarded as too *uncomfortable* to address, despite their importance. The book is not ground-breaking in its arguments, nor does it attempt to make the reader feel bad or angry. It's a book meant to bring people of all races together, to build common ground, and to correct some widespread misunderstandings. Overall, I love what Acho attempted with this book, and I hope that it can bring more people into the conversation about racism in America.
