I got mixed messages from this book, and ended up disappointed because of it. Stoller begins the book with a persuasive and motivating introduction, arguing for the merits of anti-trust action and developing the idea that a strong American anti-trust tradition ended in the 1970s due to newly elected "Watergate Baby" Democrats, driven not by greed or corruption but by a bad ideology. I thought I was in for an interesting book, one that made a compelling argument and examined and dismantled this bad ideology. Instead, I spent the next 400 pages reading a dry history that absolutely refused to engage with or even summarize the "bad ideology" that Stoller mentions. The Chicago School, the Socialists, the Watergate Babies, the Consumer-rights advocates are all wrong about capitalism and monopoly. Why? Because Matt Stoller says so, I guess.

Stoller does make a case for why a more distributed economy is better for democracy, and he links New Deal anti-trust efforts to a period of relative prosperity. He also provides a lot of detailed history about the key players in developing and destroying anti-trust legislation and enforcement, though I wish he had gone a little deeper on what the legislation actually said and what arguments the courts used when strengthening or weakening the legislation. In the end, his conclusions return to being persuasive and motivating once again. It's pretty easy to be persuasive, though, when you dismiss opposing ideas as simply wrong and then appeal to language of democracy. To be great, this book needed to take on these opposing arguments directly, and Stoller just didn't do that. If you want a well-researched play-by-play history of the ups and downs of anti-trust, though, this book may be of interest.
