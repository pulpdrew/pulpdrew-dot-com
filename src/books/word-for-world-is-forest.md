I have high expectations for anything that Le Guin writes, but _The Word for World is Forest_ didn't manage to live up to them. It's a novella about the colonization of a planet, the destruction of an ecosystem, and the subjugation of a race of human-ish aliens. Le Guin seems to be pondering the nature of racism and the human capacity for violence, but the writing often feels a little too on the nose. Captain Davidson seems to be an amalgamation of every racist, genocidal Vietnam vet and/or Nazi that any self-respecting progressive has ever shuddered at. The problem with that is that anyone reading this story is already a person that shudders to think about Davidson - he's not an interesting character at all. He's just evil, and those that oppose him are just innocent and good, and so the story lacks a truly engaging conflict. Maybe this story was more engaging decades ago when it was written and the Vietnam War was in vogue, but I don't think it's saying anything very interesting these days.
