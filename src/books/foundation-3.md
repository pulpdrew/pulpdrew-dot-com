Rounding out the first thee _Foundation_ novels, this book is a step up from the previous one. Asimov does a slightly better job of fleshing out the characters in this one, it feels a little less overtly sexist, and there are some interesting themes once again. This story focuses mostly on the titular Second Foundation, a secret society full of psychohistorians that guide the ("first") Foundation through Seldon's plan. I genuinely enjoyed the strategic back-and-forths of the characters in the second part of this story. Further, Asimov's descriptions of the mental powers of the psychohistorians feels less fantastical than those of the Mule in the previous book, since he makes at least a small attempt to present a scientific explanation.

In this book, Asimov considers what sorts of reactions people might have to idea that they're being actively controlled, and this exploration feels a little deeper than the ideas presented in the previous book. Another small but interesting part of this book is the discussion among second-foundationers about the hidden part of Seldon's plan, in which psychohistorians eventually rule over the New Empire by virtue of being good at ensuring peace and stability. This mental aristocracy is very _Plato's Republic_-esque, and while Asimov doesn't focus too much on the philosphy behind this idea in this book, it seems like he may in future books.
