This is probably the most beautiful book that I have ever read. The short chapters are full of imagery from before and after an apocalyptic pandemic. I felt the oppresion of summer heat, heard the damp quietness of snow, and smelled the horror of long-abandoned apartment buildings. I also experienced the sense of loss that so many of the characters feel throughout the novel. 

St. John Mandel uses this ever-present sense of loss to explore what is lasting and what is fleeting. Friends and family die, and knowledge is lost with them. Homes become inhabitable, technology becomes unusable, and relationships end. An object may last, but the sentimental story of how it came to be perishes. Interestingly, Shakespeare survives, as does the titular graphic novel (_Station Eleven_), but those who read and perform them are left guessing about what they truly mean, or meant. In the end, it seems that nearly everything is fragile.

If nothing lasts, then what should we care about? Should we care only about what makes us feel happy and safe while we are still living, forgetting the past and ignoring the future? Many characters in _Station Eleven_ seem to choose this path. Should we try to secure the past by recording what we can, in vague hopes that others will do the same for us? _Station Eleven's_ Museum of Civilization does just this. Or should we strive to do what we can to leave behind a legacy, even if someday, not long after we die, that legacy will likely die too? The wonder that some characters feel when dreaming about electricity or rockets make this seem like a worthwhile way to live life as well. In the end, St. John Mandel doesn't dictate what truly matters, but does make it clear that doing boring work that won't last is a stupid way to waste a life.

Overall, _Station Eleven_ was very sad, but quite a good book.
