Virtual reality! Extreme skateboarding! Heavy metal concerts! Samurai! Mild sexism! An evil conspiracy consisting of a religious cult, a monopolist, and... magic words? Yeah, that's right! This book is for all those (probably male) readers who want to f*ck the system, but only because they never really made it past their teens. Now that's some quality Cyberpunk!

Now, that's not to say Stephenson didn't contibute anything of substance with this book. He did pioneer a new vision of virtual reality, one that clearly influenced science-fiction for the following decades. He also managed to paint a picture of a future America that feels prescient in more than a few ways. And while the evil conspiracy was convoluted, it was at least interesting in the way that it brought together historical, linguistic, and religious elements. So, while the book didn't really appeal to me, it is not without some merit. If you're into cyberpunk, maybe it'll be more enjoyable for you.
