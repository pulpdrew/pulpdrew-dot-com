This book is a bit of tough love for "twentysomethings" who lack their own therapist. Like most other self-help books, this one likely won't change much about how you behave in the long run, but it is full of some interesting thoughts about how young adults should approach their twenties. Generally, Jay's advice is to take your twenties seriously - to push yourself in work and in love to build a better future for yourself. If you're someone who already does that, then this book probably isn't worth reading. But if you're a person that sees your twenties as a time for fun, low-commitment exploration, then perhaps Jay's advice would make a bigger impact on you.
