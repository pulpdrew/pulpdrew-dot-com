It feels wrong to rate this book. Sorry, _epic poem_. Is it an enjoyable read? No. It's boring most of the time, the frequent similes often feel like excessive digressions, a disturbingly large portion of the text is dedicated to animal sacrifice or human slaughter, and the women of the story exist only to be fought over by arrogant, violent, and otherwise awful male characters. With that in mind, I can't say that I liked this story. But at the same time, it _is_ an interesting glimpse into an ancient world. Those excessive similes paint a picture not only of the story that Homer is telling, but also of what Homer expected audiences to be able to relate to. Likewise, the religious, mythological, political, and social aspects are all a look at a society that was in many ways the precusor to our own. It's also pretty nice to have read something that is so often referenced. With that in mind, it seems wholly inadequate to say "I didn't like it." And so, we are left with "classic / 10."

However! I will note that the introduction by Bernard Knox was a genuinely interesting summary of what we know and don't know about the history of The Iliad (was it written or sung, by whom, and when?), Homer (did he really exist, and when?), and the Trojan War (did it really happen, when, and who actually fought in it?).
