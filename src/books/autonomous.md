Never has a novel with so many themes said so little about them. Newitz's *Autonomous* touches on IP and Copyright Laws, Privacy, Medical Ethics, Gender & Sexuality, and more, but struggles to present a meaningful thought about any of them. This book feels a little bit like Newitz (they/them) is screaming into the void, or maybe Tweeting - it mostly comes off as disorganized anger and confusion, with little thought of making anything better, and certainly no real interest in engaging with those systems or people that might disagree with their assessment of the world. 

Perhaps the one idea that I think Newitz explored sort of well is the idea of tearing down the system vs. reforming it. The debate plays out throughout the novel between the revolutionary 'drug pirate' protagonist Jack and her ex-boyfriend-turned-reformist-sellout Krish. Though I'd argue Newitz doesn't resolve this debate, it's the one part of the novel that feels remotely deep and engaging. So if that that conversation interests you, or if you're just looking for an action-packed ride across a semi-dystopian Canada, check out this book. Otherwise, I suggest passing.
