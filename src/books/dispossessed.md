This book describes a certain kind of utopia. Not one in which everyone gets everything they want, but one in which everyone is devoted to ensuring everyone else gets everything that they need. Not one in which society is *perfect*, but one that offers individuals the best chance of making society *better*. I'm still not sure I can believe that such a utopia is possible, but I know after reading this novel that I'd want to live there if it were.

Of course, the book has a variety of other themes as well. Propaganda, nationalism, loneliness, the blurring between law and morality, the intrusion of money into relationships. If you're looking for an action packed plot, this book probably isn't for you. But if you want intelligent, persuasive reflections on the world we live in, this book is the best I've read yet.
