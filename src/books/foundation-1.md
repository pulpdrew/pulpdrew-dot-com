Asimov is one of history's most famous science fiction authors, and many regard his _Foundation_ Series as one of his greatest works. The series is set over a period of 1000+ years during which an old, galaxy-spanning Empire dies and Asimov's characters attempt to establish a New Empire by following the plans of Hari Seldon. Seldon, a "psychohistorian" who uses statistics to predict the future, establishes a Foundation which he hopes will serve as the seed of this New Empire. The story is imaginative, and inspired a lot of the tropes that have dominated much of science fiction since the publication of the first _Foundation_ novel in the early 50s.

This first book contains four stories set over the course of the first ~100 years after Seldon establishes the Foundation. A common complaint about the series, and one that I agree with, is that it is hard to get attached to the characters since there are 2-4 sets of them in each book. This is made worse by the characters being fairly flat - these novels are definitely plot-driven. Another common complaint about Asimov and most sci-fi authors of his time is that they're pretty sexist. This first book has nearly no female characters at all, and exactly zero with any important role. The book is also indifferent at best towards the notion of imperialism. Like, Asimov constantly points out the evils of the Old Empire, but never takes a moment to consider the wisdom of establishing a new one? And the way in which the Foundation uses religious power, economic power, and technological superiority to essentially rule over more and more of the galaxy is... pretty familiar. Maybe this gets better in later books, though.

Something I liked about the book is its descriptions of the dying Old Empire and its stagnation. Asimov blames the stagnation largely on a stagnation of scientific progress due to an unwillingness to try new experiments and new ideas. One of Asimov's characters in particular rages against the notion that reading centuries-old textbooks is "science." This theme seems relevant in today's world.

Overall, I didn't love this book, but it is _foundational_ science fiction and offers a pretty good glimpse into the ideas that were popular during Asimov's time.
