The good news is that this is the best of the Cyberpunk books that I have read. Gibson strikes a good balance between doing enough world-building to keep me interested and focusing enough on a few characters to keep me invested in their individual story. This book also deserves props for doing so much to define the Cyberpunk genre, and its influences are clear in later Cyberpunk as well as mainstream language today (eg. popularizing "cyberspace"). It also explored many of the same themes that are still present in popular science fiction today.

The bad news is that I just don't like cyberpunk - it continues to feel like an edgy teenage boy's dream world. So this book is not for me.
