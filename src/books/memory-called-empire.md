This is the story of Mahit Dzmare, the newly-appointed ambassador from a small space station to the galaxy-spanning Teixcalaan Empire. As she arrives in the beautifully capital world of the Empire, Mahit must navigate the deadly, intricate politics of Teixcalaan with the help of her suspicious liason. With nobody to trust, and her predecessor murdered, Mahit must find a way to prevent the Empire from colonizing her station. _A Memory Called Empire_ is exciting, often sad, and always imaginative.

Throughout the book, Mahit's sense of loneliness is ever-present. She needs people she can trust, but has little trust to give. She also struggles with her own love of imperial culture and desire to be accepted as Teixcalaanli, despite Teixcalaan's cultural, economic, and physical "devouring" of her station. Author Arkady Martine (a pseudonym, potentially inspired by the character from _Foundation_, for a scholar of the Byzantine Empire) explores the meaning of Empire and colonization in a way that feels different from most other sci-fi. The story's focus is not on an internal rebellion or ongoing war, but the long, slow, destructive effects of the Empire on those places and people that it colonizes. The diverse, queer characters also distinguish this novel from more... _Foundational_ space operas. The world-building is also excellent, and I am left wanting to know so much more about the Empire and its politics, Teixcalaan's hive-mind police force, and the threatening aliens that Martine merely alludes to. Overall, I think this was a fantastic book and I am excited to read the next one.
